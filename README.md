RaspPower
=========

A Smart and Efficienct Power Supply for Raspberry Pi:


The aim of this project is to design an efficient DC-DC converter that can supply a Raspberry Pi. There will be communication between Rasp-Pi and power supply (like an [ATX Power Supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply_unit_%28computer%29)), so that features like auto shut-down, low-power mode will be possible.
