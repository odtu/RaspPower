RaspPower
=========

**A Smart and Efficient Power Supply for Raspberry Pi:**


The aim of this project is to design an efficient DC-DC converter that can supply a Raspberry Pi. There will be communication between Rasp-Pi and power supply (like an [ATX Power Supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply_unit_%28computer%29)), so that features like auto shut-down, low-power mode will be possible.

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
